# EMBL-showcase

## Introduction


This repository aims at explaining how my work is organized and to provide a list of tools that I use for analyzing sequencing data.

The folder 'bioconductor-development' provides the current code under development for [ChIPSeqSpike](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ChIPSeqSpike.html). This code is the most up-to-date in terms of my R knowledge. Other scripts provided are often developed for internal use and do not intend to use the optimal solutions necessarily. As an embeded bioinformatician, I always try to find the best compromise between code optimization and time of development.

## General Overview

### System spec

All the code has been developed on a local computer under Ubuntu operating system. I use Eclipse Oxygen 3a Release 4.7.3a committing with egit to github. I make use of specific perspectives (StatET, Perl, Java, Bash)  in Eclipse to optimize development and I am using code templates as well to increase my productivity.
The HPC system used (via scp, ssh) is [Phoenix]()
